# UI component matrix

This is the target coverage contract, not a list of completed components.
See [package and runtime boundaries](frontend-platform.md).
Rows distinguish available implementations from pending compositions. A row is complete only with exported
implementation, English resources, dark/light stories and the relevant checks
below. Several upstream stories can map to one public platform component.

The kit exports 47 shadcn primitive modules plus [base compositions](ui-kit.md)
for actions, precision inputs, async selection, forms, files, time ranges,
virtualized tables and trees. [Schema forms](schema-forms.md) use the published
schemapb engine. Storybook includes primitives, composed controls, error/readonly
states and schema fixtures in both themes. Editors, charts, observability and API-aware compositions are exported from
their [separate packages](frontend-platform.md). The inventory below uses **available** for an
existing public primitive/composition; it does not imply that every upstream
storybook example has been reproduced verbatim.

## Sources and adaptation policy

- [shadcn components](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components) and
  [semantic tokens](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming): primitive source owned by
  the kit, obtained through the pinned official CLI. No second public primitive
  vocabulary from Grafana.
- [Grafana catalog](https://developers.grafana.com/ui/latest/index.html): breadth
  reference, snapshot 2026-09-29. Stable `@grafana/ui` inspected: 13.2.3. The
  `latest` documentation may include newer source; adapters must verify that the
  pinned published package actually exports each selected component.
- [HyperDX theme](https://github.com/hyperdxio/hyperdx/tree/main/packages/app/src/theme/themes/hyperdx):
  color, density and typography reference. Selectively port useful log/trace
  presentation code with notices; do not import its application or Mantine.
- Local ErrOtel's HyperDX adaptation is a behavioral reference for structured
  JSON, precise values and timelines. Error grouping/state belongs to ErrOtel.

Grafana types stay behind adapters where practical. First try published public
exports; tightly coupled code needs a deliberate source port and provenance.
No deep imports into unstable package internals simply to make a demo compile.

## Completion checks

Every exported interactive component has keyboard operation, visible focus,
accessible name, disabled/readonly/error/loading/empty states where applicable,
and dark/light examples. Check text contrast and charts without relying on color
alone. Menus, editor completions and dialogs must agree on portal placement and
z-index, support Escape and return focus. Do not replace upstream keyboard
behavior with ad hoc click handlers.

Data-heavy components demonstrate virtualized large inputs, stable row identity,
selection across updates, timezone handling and values above JavaScript's safe
integer range. Log and trace displays preserve source data and timestamp
precision; raw strings are not rendered as executable HTML. Graph samples use
bounded downsampling and expose incomplete results. Editors/charts load lazily.

Storybook documents public props and composition, with real interaction stories
and fixtures. The compatibility fixture checks a shadcn table and form beside
Grafana visualization/time controls and a CodeMirror query editor in both modes.
The module template exercises the same components standalone and embedded.

The following are excluded from this phase: Grafana datasource administration,
plugin signatures, Grafana user management, alert-rule/policy/contact-point
management, dashboard builder, deprecated duplicate APIs. Generic equivalents
(status, badge, avatar, safe text, panel layout) remain in the kit.
