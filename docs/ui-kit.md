# Base UI kit

`@gopherex/backplane-ui` supplies 47 shadcn/Radix primitive modules, page
compositions and platform building blocks. Import its `style.css` alongside
`@gopherex/backplane-theme/style.css`. Register `englishResources` under the
`backplane.ui` i18next namespace. Both themes use the same semantic CSS tokens
and focus behavior.

## Styles and tokens

The visual language is a dense operator console: 13px text, 28–32px controls
and rows, 2–6px radii, 1px borders and no nested cards. Surfaces go from back
to front as `background` (page) → `chrome` (header, navigation) → `card`
(panels) → `raised` (table headers, hover). Color carries meaning only:
`success`, `warning`, `destructive`, `info`, `primary` and `chart-1…5`. Light
theme status colors keep WCAG AA contrast on their tinted badges.

`style.css` is one stylesheet for the whole kit family: its Tailwind build also
scans platform-ui, schema-forms, observability-ui, editors and charts. Apps and
modules that use Tailwind themselves import the preset
`@gopherex/backplane-ui/theme.css` and should also `@source` the kit sources, so
that both stylesheets agree on utility order. Modules without their own Tailwind
build compose pages from kit components only; kit components never rely on
classes the module would have to generate.

## Page compositions

| Composition | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `PageHeader` | Page title, description, meta line and actions |
| `EntityHeader`, `TabBar`, `TabItem` | Entity title with icon, status badge, meta line, actions and a router-agnostic tab bar (active via `aria-current`) |
| `Panel` | Titled section with count, actions and footer. The body scrolls itself: `fill` stretches the panel over the remaining height, `maxBodyHeight` caps it; such bodies are keyboard scroll regions |
| `StatRow`, `StatTile` | Metric tiles with tone |
| `StatusBadge`, `StatusDot`, `StatusText` | One status vocabulary: success, warning, danger, info, neutral, accent |
| `KeyValueList`, `MetaList`, `MetaItem`, `Count`, `SectionLabel` | Metadata lists, inline meta lines, counters, caps group labels |
| `EntityCard`, `Figure`, `Meter` | Entity cards with figures and proportion bars |
| `EmptyState`, `ViewToggle`, `DetailDrawer` | Empty/failure blocks, segmented view switch, right-side detail drawer (`md`, `lg`, `xl`, `full`) |
| `FilterCombo` | Filter picker over known values (static or loaded on open) with search and optional free input |
| `Timestamp`, `Duration`, `formatRelative`, `formatDuration`, `nanosToDate` | Relative time with absolute tooltip on one shared ticker; compact durations |

## Composition APIs

| Family | Public API | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Layout/text | Stack, Grid, Text, TextLink, Toolbar, IconButton | Semantic HTML, token colors, keyboard toolbar movement |
| Actions | ConfirmAction, ClipboardButton | Abortable confirmation with optional fields (a note, a reason) between description and buttons, retained failure state, clipboard success/failure |
| Text | SearchInput, SecretInput, AutoSizeInput, AutoSizeTextarea, AutoSaveInput | Clear/reveal, masked readonly secrets, size limits, blur-save with explicit retry |
| Numbers | NumberInput, stepDecimal | Controlled decimal strings and exact bigint arithmetic; units, bounds, readonly |
| Selection | Combobox, TagsInput, Cascader | Static/async and multiple selection; literal string IDs; cancellation and retry |
| Forms | FormControl plus Field components | React Hook Form Controller, field labels/descriptions/errors and native RHF rules |
| Time | DateTimeInput, TimeRangeControl, RefreshControl | ISO calendar/time controls; relative/absolute ranges, timezone, week start; no overlapping refreshes |
| Files | FileUpload | Type/size/count limits, drag/drop, progress, retry and cancellation; caller-owned upload transport |
| Feedback | StateMessage, Toaster, toast | Empty/error/offline/partial state and token-styled notifications |
| Tables | DataTable, DataColumn | Stable IDs, exact values, sorting, global filter and column filters behind a Filters toggle, visibility/order/pinning/resize, selection, hierarchy, optional paging |
| Trees | ResourceTree, TreeNode | Unique IDs, flattened virtual hierarchy, levels/positions, keyboard selection and expansion |

Schema-driven forms are a separate [package](schema-forms.md). Editors,
visualizations and platform-aware compositions have separate package boundaries.

## Large data and lifecycle

Tables and trees use TanStack Virtual and render only the viewport plus overscan.
The catalog exercises 10,000 rows/nodes. IDs must remain stable across data
updates; array indexes are not identities. Table selection is retained by ID,
including across filters and data refreshes. Consumers decide when removed IDs
should be discarded. Trees accept an acyclic hierarchy with unique IDs.

Table arrows/Home/End navigate rows; Space selects; Enter activates. Column
resize supports keyboard arrows, and column order/pinning have explicit controls.
Tree arrows expand/collapse/move to parent/child, Home/End jump, Space selects,
Enter activates and typing searches visible labels.

Async choices abort obsolete searches and ignore late results. Mutating controls
do not replay failed requests automatically. Upload callbacks must honor the
signal; cancelling suppresses further progress/result changes even if the
transport completes late. A retry starts a separate attempt.

TimeRangeControl lazily loads Grafana behind a public adapter; raw values are
strings and Grafana types stay internal. DateTimeInput itself represents calendar
text: callers must apply a timezone before converting it to an instant. Refresh
intervals are milliseconds; zero disables automatic refresh. Only one refresh
may run at a time, and unmount aborts it.

## Verification

`make web-check` builds packages and fixtures, checks TypeScript, runs unit and
browser acceptance, builds Storybook and checks it in dark/light themes. Catalog
families cover primitives, composed controls, form validation/failure recovery,
large tables/trees, uploads, time controls, unavailable/readonly/empty states and
schema forms. Tests include keyboard/focus interactions and WCAG AA scans.

## Foundations and runtime helpers

`Icon`, `UserAvatar`, `UsersIndicator`, `FeatureBadge`, `FilterPill` and `Segment`
use the same tokens and controls as other families. `ErrorBoundary` isolates a
failed subtree and supports explicit reset or `resetKey`. `useClickOutside`
accepts multiple refs and respects composed event paths; `useDelayedSwitch`
cleans up its timers. The Foundations stories cover utility recovery and token/
typography inspection in both modes.

## Authoring guidance

Use semantic tokens for every surface, border, focus ring and status. Keep
English text in a namespace; package defaults are English and modules install
`module.<service>` resources. Use short action verbs, explicit nouns for labels,
and actionable errors that preserve the user's input. Do not present internal
transport or deployment settings as product tasks.

Label controls, preserve upstream keyboard behavior, and make overlays return
focus. Virtual tables support pointer activation and Enter independently of row
selection; nested buttons/inputs do not also activate the row. Graphs provide
exact-value tables and textual status alongside colors. Automated browser checks
use axe in both themes; this is an acceptance baseline, not a claim that every
possible author composition is automatically accessible.
