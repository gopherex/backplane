# Hooks and activities

A **hook** is an extension point owned by the caller. An **activity** is a capability offered by a service. A binding connects them without making either service import the other's implementation.

```go
type GreetIn struct { Name string `json:"name"` }
type GreetOut struct { Text string `json:"text"` }

greet := hook.Declare[GreetIn, GreetOut](component, "Greet",
    hook.Required(), hook.DefaultTimeout(5*time.Second),
    hook.Describe("greets a name"))
```

Declarations belong to a component during tree construction. The fully qualified identity includes the service (`hello.Greet`). `Required` communicates that the hook expects a binding; it does not implement a local fallback for you.

## Offer an activity

```go
activity.Handle(component, "Format", format,
    activity.StartToClose(10*time.Second),
    activity.Retry(activity.RetryHint{Attempts: 3}),
    activity.Describe("formats a greeting"))
```

Here `format` is your typed `func(context.Context, Input) (Output, error)`. Declare realistic timeouts and retry hints. Mark permanent validation failures with `activity.NonRetryable(err)`. Long operations can send `activity.Heartbeat`; `activity.InfoOf(ctx)` exposes execution metadata including the idempotency key.

## Call and fallback

Call the declared reference from request code using its `Call` method. Handle `hook.ErrNoBinding` explicitly if the service has a local fallback. Propagate other failures rather than disguising an unavailable durable execution as an unbound hook.

In a Temporal workflow use `workflows.CallHook(ctx, ref, input, options...)`. Workflow code must remain deterministic; ordinary network calls belong in activities.

The hello example records the delivered greeting and emits `Greeted` after both bound and local execution. Side effects that describe the final result must run on both paths. An HTTP idempotency key can deduplicate hook execution without automatically deduplicating the whole HTTP handler or its later event emission.

## Operator control

Bindings are revisioned definitions. Operators map the hook input to activity inputs with CEL, compose multiple steps and define a result. Use [Wiring](../guides/wiring.md) to analyze, test and publish them. Retrying a request after a lost response can duplicate side effects; inspect its operation/run state before repeating it.
