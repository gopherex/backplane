# Test a service and its integrations

Choose checks for the boundary you changed. Fast tests of payload validation and component behavior do not require every platform dependency. Delivery, failover and gateway routing need real infrastructure.

## Layers

| Layer | What to establish |
| --- | --- |
| Domain/unit | Validation, pure transformations, fallback decisions and idempotency behavior |
| SDK/component | Startup failure, optional dependency recovery, cancellation, probes and accepted/rejected live configuration |
| Contract | Generated clients, schemas, route documents and manifest consistency |
| Runtime integration | JetStream delivery, Temporal execution, cookie relay and configuration reconciliation |
| Deployment/browser | Real assets, deep links, CSP, theme, authentication and service registration |
| Multiple replicas | Shared consumers, concurrent reconciliation, crash/rejoin and endpoint retirement |

The `pkg/backplane/backplanetest` package and repository conformance tests provide reusable examples of SDK behavior. Keep test stores and durable consumer names isolated from a development installation.

## Component harness

`backplanetest.New(t, backplanetest.Name("hello"))` constructs a service tree with recording transports, without `Open`, listeners or Consul. Build your components under `h.Root()`, substitute providers with `deps.Static(value)` and call `h.Start()`. Cleanup stops the tree under a bounded shutdown budget.

| Helper | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `Config[C](t, vars)` | Load schema defaults and explicit environment-style values without reading process env/files/Consul |
| `Ready(h)` | Inspect readiness with required-dependency reasons |
| `Answer(h, hookRef, fn)` | Supply a hook answer |
| `Events(h, eventRef)` / `EventsWithMeta` | Inspect published payloads and IDs/keys/headers |
| `FailPublish(h, err)` | Exercise publication failure |
| `Unavailable(h)` / `Available(h)` | Exercise transport loss and recovery |
| `Activity[Req, Res](ctx, h, name, input)` | Invoke a declared activity once |
| `ReactConsumer(ctx, h, consumer, value)` | Deliver once to a pinned reactor |
| `SetLive(&field, value)` | Update a live field and notify its watchers |
| `h.Manifest()` | Inspect declarations and declaration errors |

The harness does not simulate JetStream redelivery or DLQ semantics. Its activity call executes once; retries belong in runtime integration tests. For Temporal code, use `pkg/backplane/workflows/workflowtest.New(t, h)`, which supplies a Temporal test environment with the service's registrations. This testing extension intentionally imports Temporal separately from core component tests.

## Repository commands

```bash
GOWORK=off make test
# Start infrastructure only for the integration targets you need:
make up
make conformance
make test-envoy
make test-m1
make test-m2
make test-replicas
```

Run live targets sequentially without manually running examples that register the same service names. `make test-replicas` uses two Backplane processes against a scratch database and exercises shared rule delivery, configuration, bound events, crash/rejoin and Nexus retirement with retained manifests.

For frontend contracts use `make web-check` or the narrower package/unit/browser target relevant to the edit. `yarn test:packed` installs package tarballs in fresh consumers, so workspace aliases cannot hide missing exports or packaged files.

## Full verification and releases

`make verify` is an explicitly requested full-stack check with an isolated Compose project. Normal CI selects checks from changed paths. `make release` performs no local builds or tests; the release workflow requires successful commit CI and packages the release.

Do not report a skipped integration test as a passed live check. Record which dependencies were present and whether the result proves a local contract, a backend integration or an end-to-end user operation. See [development reference](../reference/development.md).
