# Replicas, outages and retirement

Backplane replicas share PostgreSQL, Consul and Valkey. Optional runtimes must address the same intended installation resources. Keep configuration and secrets consistent across replicas and advertise reachable service addresses.

## Concurrent control work

Database transactions and revision checks protect configuration and definition updates. Reconciliation is designed to run on multiple replicas. Audit outbox workers lease records with PostgreSQL `SKIP LOCKED`; a crashed worker's lease can be reclaimed. Export is at least once, so downstream consumers use stable audit IDs for deduplication.

Rules share durable delivery/execution identities. A duplicate event or replica rejoin must not create an independent business execution merely because another server processed it. Business activities still need their own idempotency for retried external effects.

## What an outage means

| Failure | Expected operational consequence |
| --- | --- |
| PostgreSQL | Control persistence and audit unavailable; mutations cannot safely proceed |
| Consul | Discovery/configuration reconciliation impaired; do not infer service absence from a failed read |
| Valkey | Login protection unavailable; login refuses rather than bypassing it |
| Temporal | Durable workflow/hook/schedule operations fail; core capabilities remain independently configured |
| NATS | Event delivery/operations impaired; no implication that a prior publish was rolled back |
| Victoria store | Queries for that signal fail; platform startup does not depend on contacting it |
| Collector/export | Telemetry delivery delayed/failed according to exporter queues; durable audit remains in PostgreSQL |

Infrastructure UI reports OK/NO/disabled for configured probes. It does not certify the whole path from application emission to stored query result.

## Retire departed services

Owned Nexus endpoints are checked on reconciliation. Retirement requires confirmed service absence, not merely failing health checks. The normal grace period is five minutes, with reconciliation on a one-minute interval. A Consul read failure defers deletion. Ownership/version checks prevent a stale replica from deleting a replacement endpoint.

Historical manifests remain available. Returning services can recreate their endpoint. This is resource cleanup, not a catalog-history purge or a deployment action.

## Rollout and recovery checklist

1. Back up PostgreSQL and persistent runtime data using their native procedures.
2. Keep service/workflow contracts compatible with in-flight and scheduled work.
3. Roll replicas while observing registration, readiness and configuration application.
4. Inspect unknown external-command audit outcomes after interruptions.
5. Verify one end-to-end operation per enabled runtime after recovery.

`make test-replicas` exercises two real Backplane processes, shared rules, configuration, crash/rejoin and endpoint retirement in the reference topology. It is evidence for those scenarios, not a substitute for testing your load balancer, database failover or storage recovery.
