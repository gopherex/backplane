# Connect hooks and events

Bindings implement declared hooks. Rules react to declared events. Both use the same typed step language and activity catalog, with YAML and graph editors over one draft.

## Bind hello to formatter

With the [example installation](../quickstart.md) running, open Wiring and select `hello.Greet`. This is the actual demo binding:

```yaml
hook: hello.Greet
description: Greets through the formatter service.
steps:
  formatted:
    activity: formatter.Format
    input: {name: req.name}
result: {text: formatted.text}
```

`req` is the hook input. A step's output is available by its name (`formatted`). String values in expression trees are CEL expressions; use a quoted CEL string literal when you mean constant text rather than a field reference. Structured objects and arrays preserve their shape.

Analyze the definition, correct reported violations, test it with a name, then save. The demo setup already installs this binding, so edits should use its current version.

## Add an event rule

```yaml
event: hello.Greeted
description: Records every greeting except "skip".
when: event.name != "skip"
steps:
  recorded:
    activity: formatter.Record
    input: {name: event.name, text: event.text}
```

`event` is the payload, not its transport envelope. Metadata is available through the rule's declared environment. A rule needs at least one step. It requires both event delivery and Temporal execution. Pausing it changes operator state; a reactor written in a service remains an independent consumer.

## Compose a flow

Data references establish dependencies between steps. Explicit `after` adds ordering where no value flows. `when` conditionally runs a step. Activity options control retries and timeouts; compensation (`undo`) must be designed for the actual external effect, not assumed to be a transaction rollback.

For-each steps run an activity or a subflow over a list. Choose item naming, concurrency, error policy and a limit deliberately. Body steps see their item and allowed enclosing values. A bounded parallel loop can still create substantial downstream load; set concurrency to the capacity of the target operation.

The graph shows data, condition and explicit-order edges differently. Dragging ports writes references into the same YAML draft. Nested loops are frames; run overlays show per-item progress. Renames use server analysis rather than string replacement.

## Validate, test, publish

1. The editor checks syntax and shape immediately.
2. `WiringService` analyzes expressions against current manifests and reports source locations, expected types and reads.
3. Test runs execute the draft; they can cause real activity side effects.
4. Save uses a base version. On conflict, compare with the latest version before continuing.
5. Inspect the run and its step timeline. A successful save only publishes the definition.

History supports review and rollback. A removed/changed service contract can invalidate an existing definition; the UI marks broken definitions rather than silently rewriting them. Unsaved drafts survive switching items and require confirmation before leaving.
